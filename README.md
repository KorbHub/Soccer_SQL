Soccer data analysis used SQL

This notebook I used to practice some SQL techniques from open-source Kaggle data(Exploring the European Soccer Database with SQL). We will explore the European Soccer DataBase to gain the insight from the dataset with SQL techniques.

**The European Soccer Database**

The European Soccer Database contains information on the teams, match results and players for the top division football leagues across Europe. We can look at every season between 08/09 and 15/16.
